# Smart PhD Lab 5.0

A digital platform supporting project-based doctoral education at the University of Telecommunications and Posts (UTP) in Sofia, Bulgaria, developed as part of an EU-funded initiative under the **Education 2021-2027** program co-financed by the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+).

## What is Smart PhD Lab 5.0?

Smart PhD Lab 5.0 is a centralized ecosystem designed to modernize and streamline the management of PhD programs across three partner universities:

- **University of Telecommunications and Posts (UTP)** — Sofia
- **Mining and Geology University "St. Ivan Rilski"**
- **Technical University — Varna**

The platform bridges academic administration, student progress tracking, and public communication — bringing together supervisors, doctoral students, and administrators in one place.

## Why It Exists

PhD programs are complex to manage: students juggle courses across platforms, supervisors track individual development plans, and institutions need to communicate program information to prospective and current participants. Smart PhD Lab 5.0 solves this by unifying these scattered workflows into a single, accessible platform aligned with:

- **Industry 5.0** standards
- **Green transition** goals
- **Smart Specialization Strategy (TSSS) 2021–2027**
- Regional labor market needs
