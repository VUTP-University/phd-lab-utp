Industrial Engineering is an interdisciplinary engineering field focused on the design, analysis, 
optimization, and management of complex industrial and organizational systems. 
It combines engineering principles with methods from mathematics, economics, 
and management to improve efficiency, productivity, quality, and sustainability in industrial 
and service-oriented environments.

Within the PhD Study Program in General Engineering (Professional Field 5.13), 
research in Industrial Engineering covers a broad range of topics, including optimization of production 
and logistics systems, supply chain management, industrial information systems, 
process automation and digitalization, modeling and simulation, quality management, 
as well as the application of artificial intelligence and data analytics in industrial contexts.

The program aims to educate highly qualified researchers capable of 
conducting independent scientific research, developing innovative solutions to modern industrial challenges, 
and contributing to the advancement of both theory and practice in the field of Industrial Engineering.
