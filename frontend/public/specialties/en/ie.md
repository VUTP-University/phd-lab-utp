The Doctoral Program in **Industrial Engineering** provides a **rigorous academic environment** for the advanced study of the **design, optimization, and management** of complex industrial systems and processes. Bridging theoretical engineering principles with applied methodologies, the program equips doctoral candidates with the expertise needed to tackle multifaceted challenges in modern **industrial and manufacturing environments**.

Research within this program spans a broad spectrum of topics, including **production systems engineering**, **operations research**, **quality management**, **lean and agile manufacturing**, **ergonomics**, and **supply chain optimization**. Candidates also explore the integration of **digital technologies** into industrial processes — at the forefront of **Industry 4.0** and **smart manufacturing** paradigms — where data-driven decision-making and automation are reshaping entire industries.

Doctoral candidates are encouraged to develop research agendas that are both **theoretically grounded and practically relevant**, with real potential for application in industrial and policy contexts. **Collaboration with industry partners** and participation in applied research projects are integral to the doctoral experience, accelerating the translation of academic insight into concrete engineering solutions.

Upon completion, graduates are prepared to **lead in academic research**, engineering consultancy, industrial management, and within national or international bodies responsible for the **standardization and governance of engineering practices**.
