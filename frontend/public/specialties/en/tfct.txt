Theoretical Foundations of Communication Engineering is a fundamental scientific field that 
studies the principles, models, and methods for the analysis, design, and optimization of modern communication 
systems and networks. It focuses on the theoretical aspects of information transmission, 
processing, and reception across various communication media, including wired, wireless, and optical channels.

Within Professional Field 5.3 – Communication and Computer Engineering, 
research activities address topics such as signal and systems theory, 
information and coding theory, modulation and multiplexing techniques, 
digital signal processing, communication channel modeling, noise and interference resilience, 
as well as the analysis and optimization of communication protocols and network architectures.

The PhD training in this field aims to develop highly qualified researchers 
with strong theoretical backgrounds and the ability to conduct independent scientific research, 
propose new models and methods, and contribute to the advancement of modern communication technologies 
and information systems.
